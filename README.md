# Traffic-Light
This simulation is based on four crossroads with four traffic lights. I make traffic lights change color for 10 seconds. When the traffic lights green for 10 seconds, then the traffic light will turn red and the next traffic light will turn orange for 2 seconds and then turns green. This traffic lights showing through one 7SEG-MPX1-CC and four traffic lights. IC type used at89c51 with SDCC compiler and AVR Core Clock frequency 12MHz.
